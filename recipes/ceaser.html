      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
          <p>This classic Caesar salad recipe features crisp romaine lettuce, homemade croutons, and a rich, creamy dressing made from scratch. The combination of fresh garlic, anchovy paste, and Parmesan cheese creates that distinctive Caesar flavor that's impossible to resist.</p>
          <p>While many modern versions skip the anchovy, this traditional recipe embraces it, creating a perfect balance of flavors that has made this salad a restaurant favorite for decades. The homemade croutons add a delicious crunch that store-bought varieties just can't match.</p>
